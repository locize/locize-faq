For static websites we usually suggest to start with [locizify](https://github.com/locize/locizify). It's optimal for websites, you have the most minimal overhead to instrument your code and it's even suitable for non developers, too.

For more advanced use-cases and better control through the code instrumentation we suggest [i18next](https://docs.locize.com/instrumenting-your-code.html#i18next). It's usable on web, mobile, desktop and server environments, has very flexible translations options like, plurals, interpolation, context, etc... and has a big ecosystem \([frameworks](https://www.i18next.com/supported-frameworks.html) [plugins](https://www.i18next.com/plugins-and-utils.html)\).

The most low-level integration can be done with our [API](https://docs.locize.com/api.html). Using our API you can build anything you could think of.

As you can see, the answer is "It depends" ;-\)
