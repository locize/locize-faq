The namespace files are the consumable translation memory. So keeping your namespaces uptodate automatically keeps your TM clean and uptodate. Doing a TM lookup for a segment shows all possible (fuzzy) matches including a link to the source segment.

Every namespace / project acts directly as the TM. That way maintaining it and keeping it consistent is very natural and not an extra work. You can import tmx to a namespace.
